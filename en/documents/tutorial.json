Developers no longer expect visualization products to be simple chart creation tools, but have more advanced needs in terms of interaction, performance, data processing, and more.</p>\n<p>Apache ECharts has always been committed to making it easier for developers to create flexible and rich visualizations. In the latest release of Apache ECharts 5, we have focused on enhancing the storytelling of charts, allowing developers to tell the story behind the data in a simpler way.</p>\n<p><img src=\"documents/asset/img/feature-v5/echarts-5-en.png\" width=\"800px\" /></p>\n<p>&quot;The core of Apache ECharts 5 is &quot;Show, do not tell&quot;, which is a comprehensive upgrade of five topics and 15 features around the stroy telling of visualizations, allowing charts to better tell the story behind the data. It helps developers to create visualizations that meet the needs of various scenarios more easily.</p>\n<h2 id=\"storytelling\">Storytelling</h2>\n<p>The importance of animation to human cognition cannot be overstated. In our previous work, we used initialization animations and transition animations to help users understand the connection between data transformations, making the appearance of charts and transformations seem less rigid. This time, we have even enhanced our animation capabilities, even more significantly. We hope to further exploit the role of animation to help users&#39; cognition, and help them understand the story behind the chart more easily with the dynamic stroy function of the chart.</p>\n<h4 id=\"bar-line-racing\">Bar/Line Racing</h4>\n<p>Apache ECharts 5 adds support for dynamically sorted bar-racing and dynamically sorted line-racing charts to help developers easily create time-series charts that show changes in data over time and tell the evolution of data.</p>\n<iframe data-src=\"https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/view.html?c=bar-race-country&edit=1&reset=1\" width=\"700\" height=\"400\" ></iframe>\n\n\n<iframe data-src=\"https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/view.html?c=line-race&edit=1&reset=1\" width=\"700\" height=\"400\" ></iframe>\n\n\n<p>The dynamic sorting chart shows the derivation of different categories in the ranking over time. The developer can enable this effect in ECharts with a few simple configuration code.</p>\n<h4 id=\"custom-series-animation\">Custom Series Animation</h4>\n<p>In addition to dynamic sorting charts, Apache ECharts 5 provides even richer and more powerful animations in the custom series, supporting interpolation animations for label value text, transition animations for morph, combine, separate, and other effects of graphics.</p>\n<p>Imagine what amazing visualizations you can create with these dynamic effects!</p>\n<h2 id=\"visual-design\">Visual Design</h2>\n<p>The role of visual design is not only to make the chart look better, but more importantly, a design that conforms to the principles of visualization can help users understand more quickly what the chart is trying to say and eliminate as much misunderstanding as possible from poor design.</p>\n<h4 id=\"overall-design\">Overall Design</h4>\n<p>We have found that a large percentage of developers use the default theme style for ECharts, so it is important to have an elegant default theme design. In Apache ECharts 5, we redesigned the default theme style, optimizing it for different charts and components. For example, we took into account factors such as differentiation between colors, contrast with background colors, and harmony with adjacent colors, and ensured that people with color blindness could clearly distinguish data.</p>\n<p><img src=\"documents/asset/img/feature-v5/theme-color.png\" width=\"400px\" /></p>\n<p>Let&#39;s look at the new version of the light and dark theme styles using the most commonly used bar chart as an example.</p>\n<p><img src=\"documents/asset/img/feature-v5/new-theme-light.png\" width=\"500px\" />\n<img src=\"documents/asset/img/feature-v5/new-theme-dark.png\" width=\"500px\" /></p>\n<p>For the data area zoom, timeline and other interactive components, we also designed a new style and provide a better interactive experience: &lt;img src=&quot;documents/asset/img/feature/v5/new-theme-dark.png</p>\n<p><img src=\"documents/asset/img/feature-v5/dataZoom.png\" width=\"500px\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"documents/asset/img/feature-v5/timeline.png\" width=\"500px\" /></p>\n<h4 id=\"label\">Label</h4>\n<p>Labels are one of the core elements of a chart, and clear and unambiguous labels help users to have a more accurate understanding of the data. Apache ECharts 5 provides a variety of new labeling features that allow dense labels to be clearly displayed and accurately represented.</p>\n<p>Apache ECharts 5 can be enabled to automatically hide overlapping labels through a configuration item. For labels that exceed the display area, you can choose to automatically truncate or line break them. Dense pie chart labels now have a more aesthetically pleasing automatic layout.</p>\n<p>These features can help avoid text that is too dense and affects readability. And, no additional code needs to be written by the developer for them to take effect by default, greatly simplifying the development cost for developers.</p>\n<p>We also provide several configuration options to allow developers to actively control the layout strategy of tabs, such as tab dragging, overall display at the edge of the canvas, connecting with guide lines and graphical elements, and still linking to highlight the associated relationships.</p>\n<p>The new label feature allows you to have very clear label presentation even in a confined space mobile:</p>\n<p><img src=\"documents/asset/img/feature-v5/pie-label.png\" height=\"150px\" />\n<img src=\"documents/asset/img/feature-v5/pie-label-2.png\" height=\"150px\" /></p>\n<h4 id=\"time-axis\">Time Axis</h4>\n<p>Apache ECharts 5 brings a time axis suitable for expressing timestamp scales. The default design of the time axis highlights important information more prominently and provides more flexible customization capabilities, allowing developers to tailor the time axis&#39;s label content to different needs.</p>\n<p>First of all, the time axis is no longer split absolutely evenly as before, but instead selects more meaningful points like year, month, day, and whole point to display, and can show different levels of scales at the same time. The <code class=\"codespan\">formatter</code> of labels supports templates for time (e.g. <code class=\"codespan\">{yyyy}-{MM}-{dd}</code>), and different <code class=\"codespan\">formatter</code> can be specified for labels with different time granularity, which can be combined with rich text labels to create eye-catching and diverse time effects.</p>\n<p>The display of the time scale at different dataZoom granularities.</p>\n<p><img src=\"documents/asset/img/feature-v5/time-axis.png\" width=\"600px\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"documents/asset/img/feature-v5/time-axis-2.png\" width=\"600px\" /></p>\n<h4 id=\"tooltip\">Tooltip</h4>\n<p>Tooltip is one of the most commonly used visualization components to help users interactively understand the details of data. In Apache ECharts 5, we have optimized the style of the tooltip, making the default display of the tooltip elegant and clear by adjusting the font style, color, arrow pointing to the graph, border color following the graph color, and other features. The rendering logic of rich text has been improved to ensure that the display is consistent with the HTML way, allowing users to choose different technical solutions to achieve the same effect in different scenarios.</p>\n<p><img src=\"documents/asset/img/feature-v5/new-tooltip.png\" height=\"200px\" />\n<img src=\"documents/asset/img/feature-v5/new-tooltip-2.png\" height=\"200px\" /></p>\n<p>In addition to this, we have also added the ability to sort the list in the tip box by value size or category order this time.</p>\n<h4 id=\"gauge\">Gauge</h4>\n<p>We have seen a lot of cool gauge charts created by community users, but the way they are configured is often complex and tricky. Therefore, we have upgraded the gauge to support image or vector path drawing pointers, anchor configurations, progress bars, rounded corner effects, and more.</p>\n<p>Different styles of gauge pointers.</p>\n<p><img src=\"documents/asset/img/feature-v5/gauge-pointer.png\" width=\"600px\" /></p>\n<p>These upgrades not only allow developers to achieve cool effects with simpler configuration items, but also bring richer customization capabilities.</p>\n<iframe data-src=\"https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/view.html?c=gauge-clock&edit=1&reset=1\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" ></iframe>\n\n\n<h4 id=\"round-corner\">Round Corner</h4>\n<p>Apache ECharts 5 supports round corner for pie charts, sunburst charts, and treemap charts. Don&#39;t underestimate the simplicity of the rounded corners configuration, but combine them with other effects to create a more personalized visualization.</p>\n<iframe data-src=\"https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/view.html?c=sunburst-borderRadius&edit=1&reset=1\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" ></iframe>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"interactivity\">Interactivity</h2>\n<p>The interactivity of the visualization helps users explore the work and deepen their understanding of the main idea of the diagram.</p>\n<h4 id=\"multi-state\">Multi-State</h4>\n<p>In ECharts 4, there were two interactive states, <code class=\"codespan\">emphasis</code> and <code class=\"codespan\">normal</code>, graph will enter the <code class=\"codespan\">emphasis</code> state when the mouse hovered to distinguish the data.</p>\n<p>This time in Apache ECharts 5, we have added a new effect of <strong>blur</strong> other non-related elements to the original mouse hover highlighting, so that the target data can be focused.</p>\n<p>For example, in this <a href=\"https://echarts.apache.org/examples/zh/editor.html?c=bar-y-category-stack\" target=\"_blank\">bar chart</a> example, when the mouse hovers over a series, other non-related series will fade out, thus highlighting more clearly the comparison of data in the focused series. of data in the comparison. On diagrams with more complex data structures such as relationship, tree, sunburst, sankey, etc., it is also possible to see the connections between data by fading out non-related elements. Also, colors, shadows, and other styles that can be set in <code class=\"codespan\">emphasis</code> can now be set in <code class=\"codespan\">blur</code>.</p>\n<p>In addition, we&#39;ve added <strong>click to select</strong> to all series, an interaction that was previously only available in a few series such as pie charts and maps, allowing developers to set it to single or multiple selection mode, and to listen to the <code class=\"codespan\">selectchanged</code> event to get all the selected shapes for further processing. As with <code class=\"codespan\">emphasis</code> and <code class=\"codespan\">blur</code>, the selection style can also be configured in <code class=\"codespan\">select</code>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"performance-improvements\">Performance improvements</h4>\n<h5 id=\"dirty-rectangle-rendering\">Dirty Rectangle Rendering</h5>\n<p>Apache ECharts 5 has new support for dirty rectangle rendering to address performance bottlenecks in large scenes with only local changes. When using the Canvas renderer, the dirty rectangle rendering technique detects and updates only the parts of the view that have changed, rather than any changes causing a complete redraw of the canvas. This can help improve rendering frame rates in some special scenarios, such as scenes where the mouse frequently triggers some graphical highlighting many times. In the past for such scenes, additional Canvas layers were used to optimize performance, but this approach is not universal for all scenes and does not work well for complex styles. Dirty Rectangle rendering does a good job of satisfying both performance and display correctness.</p>\n<p>A visual demonstration of a dirty rectangle, with the red boxed area redrawn for the frame.</p>\n<p><img src=\"documents/asset/img/feature-v5/dirty-rect.gif\" width=\"500px\" /></p>\n<p>You can see the effect by enable dirty rectangle optimization on the new example page.</p>\n<h5 id=\"line-chart-performance-optimization-for-real-time-time-series-data\">Line Chart Performance Optimization for Real-Time Time-Series Data</h5>\n<p>In addition, the performance of line graphs with large amounts of data has also seen a significant performance improvement. We often encounter the need for high-performance plotting of large amounts of real-time time-series data, which will be updated every hundreds or tens of milliseconds.</p>\n<p>Apache ECharts 5 deeply optimizes CPU consumption, memory usage, and initialization time in these scenarios, enabling real-time updates (less than 30ms per update) for millions of data, and even rendering within 1s for ten millions of data, with low memory usage and smooth tooltip interactions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"development-experience\">Development Experience</h2>\n<p>We want such a powerful visualization tool to be used by more developers in a simpler way, so the developer experience is also a very important aspect for us.</p>\n<h4 id=\"datasets\">Datasets</h4>\n<p>ECharts 5 enhances the data transformation capabilities of datasets, allowing developers to implement common data processing such as filtering, sorting, aggregating, histogram, simple clustering, regression, etc. in a simple way. Developers can use these functions in a uniform and declarative way, and can easily implement common data operations.</p>\n<h4 id=\"internationalization\">Internationalization</h4>\n<p>The original internationalization implementation of ECharts takes the form of different distribution files packaged according to different language parameters. In this way, the dynamic language and main code are bound together, and the only way to switch languages when using ECharts is to reload different language versions of ECharts distributions.</p>\n<p>Therefore, starting with Apache ECharts 5, the dynamic language is separated from the main code. To switch languages, you only need to load the corresponding language, use the <code class=\"codespan\">registerLocale</code> function to mount the language object in a similar way to mount the theme, and then reinitialize it to complete the language switch.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-js\">// import the lang object and set when init\necharts.registerLocale(&#39;DE&#39;, lang).\necharts.init(DomElement, null, {\n   locale: &#39;DE&#39;\n});\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"typescript-refactoring\">TypeScript Refactoring</h4>\n<p>In order to continue to refactor and develop new features more safely and efficiently, we started the development of Apache ECharts 5 by rewriting the code using TypeScript. The strong typing brought by TypeScript gave us the confidence to refactor the code drastically to achieve more exciting features during the development of ECharts 5.</p>\n<p>For developers, we can also generate better and more code-compliant <code class=\"codespan\">DTS</code> type description files directly from TypeScript code. Until now, ECharts type description files have been maintained by community developers and published to <a href=\"https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/types/echarts\" target=\"_blank\">DefinityTyped</a>, which is a lot of work, so thanks for your contribution.</p>\n<p>In addition, if a developer&#39;s component is introduced on-demand, we provide a <code class=\"codespan\">ComposeOption</code> type method that can combine a configuration item type that contains only the introduced components, which can bring stricter type checking and help you detect unintroduced component types in advance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"accessibility\">Accessibility</h2>\n<p>Apache ECharts has always taken accessibility design seriously, and we want to make the information conveyed by charts equally to be accessed. We also want to make this possible for chart developers at a very low development cost, thus making developers more willing to support the accessibility.</p>\n<p>In the last major release, we supported automatic intelligent generation of chart descriptions based on different chart types and data, making it very easy for developers to support DOM description information for charts. In ECharts 5, we have also made more accessibility improvements to help people with visual impairments better understand the chart content.</p>\n<h4 id=\"theme-colors\">Theme Colors</h4>\n<p>We took accessibility into account when designing the new default theme, and we repeatedly tested the brightness and color values of the colors to help accessibility users clearly identify the chart data.</p>\n<p>Moreover, for developers with further accessibility needs, we also provide special high-contrast themes to further differentiate the data with higher contrast colors.</p>\n<h4 id=\"decal-patterns\">Decal Patterns</h4>\n<p>ECharts 5 also provides a new feature of decals to help users further differentiate data by using patterns to assist with color representation.</p>\n<iframe data-src=\"https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/view.html?c=doc-example/aria-decal-simple&edit=1&reset=1\" width=\"600\" height=\"350\" ></iframe>\n\n\n<p>In addition, decal patterns can also help in some other scenarios, such as: helping to better distinguish data in printed materials like newspapers and books that have only a single color or very few colors; using graphical elements to facilitate a more intuitive understanding of the data by the user.</p>\n<iframe data-src=\"https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/view.html?c=doc-example/aria-decal-newspaper&edit=1&reset=1\" width=\"600\" height=\"350\" ></iframe>\n\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n<p>In addition to the features described above, Apache ECharts has been improved in a very large number of details to help developers more easily create charts that good by default, are flexible in configuration, and tell the story behind the data with charts.</p>\n<p>Thank you to all the developers who have used ECharts, and even participated in community contributions, for making Apache ECharts 5 possible. We&#39;ll be working on future developments with even more enthusiasm, and we&#39;ll see you all in 6 with even more enthusiasm!</p>\n"},"ECharts 5 Upgrade Guide":{"type":["*"],"description":"<p>This guide is for those who want to upgrade from echarts 4.x (hereafter <code class=\"codespan\">v4</code>) to echarts 5.x (hereafter <code class=\"codespan\">v5</code>). You can find out what new features <code class=\"codespan\">v5</code> brings that are worth upgrading in <a href=\"tutorial.html#ECharts%205%20Upgrade%20Guide\" target=\"_blank\">New Features in ECharts 5</a>. In most cases, developers won&#39;t need to do anything extra for this upgrade, as echarts has always tried to keep the API as stable and backward-compatible as possible. However, <code class=\"codespan\">v5</code> still brings some breaking changes that require special attention. In addition, in some cases, <code class=\"codespan\">v5</code> provides a better API to replace the previous one, and these superseded APIs will no longer be recommended (though we have tried to be as compatible as possible with these changes). We&#39;ll try to explain these changes in detail in this document.</p>\n<p>Since we added the new <a href=\"tutorial.html#Use%20ECharts%20with%20bundler%20and%20NPM\" target=\"_blank\">tree-shaking API</a> in <code class=\"codespan\">v5.0.1</code>, this documentation is based on <code class=\"codespan\">v5.0.1</code> or higher.</p>\n<h2 id=\"breaking-changes\">Breaking Changes</h2>\n<h4 id=\"default-theme\">Default theme</h4>\n<p>First of all, the default theme has been changed. <code class=\"codespan\">v5</code> has made a lot of changes and optimizations on the theme design. If you still want to keep the colors of the old version, you can manually declare the colors as follows.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-js\">chart.setOption({\n    color: [\n        &#39;#c23531&#39;, &#39;#2f4554&#39;, &#39;#61a0a8&#39;, &#39;#d48265&#39;, &#39;#91c7ae&#39;, &#39;#749f83&#39;,\n        &#39;#ca8622&#39;, &#39;#bda29a&#39;, &#39;#6e7074&#39;, &#39;#546570&#39;, &#39;#c4ccd3&#39;\n    ],\n    // ...\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or, to make a simple <code class=\"codespan\">v4</code> theme.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-js\">var themeEC4 = {\n    color: [\n        &#39;#c23531&#39;, &#39;#2f4554&#39;, &#39;#61a0a8&#39;, &#39;#d48265&#39;, &#39;#91c7ae&#39;, &#39;#749f83&#39;,\n        &#39;#ca8622&#39;, &#39;#bda29a&#39;, &#39;#6e7074&#39;, &#39;#546570&#39;, &#39;#c4ccd3&#39;\n    ]\n};\nvar chart = echarts.init(dom, themeEC4);\nchart.setOption(/* ... */);\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"importing-echarts\">Importing ECharts</h4>\n<h5 id=\"removing-support-for-default-exports\">Removing support for default exports</h5>\n<p>Since <code class=\"codespan\">v5</code>, echarts only provides <code class=\"codespan\">named exports</code>.</p>\n<p>So if you are importing <code class=\"codespan\">echarts</code> like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-js\">import echarts from &#39;echarts&#39;;\n// Or import core module\nimport echarts from &#39;echarts/lib/echarts&#39;;\n</code></pre>\n<p>It will throw error in <code class=\"codespan\">v5</code>. You need to change the code as follows to import the entire module.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-js\">import * as echarts from &#39;echarts&#39;;\n// Or\nimport * as echarts from &#39;echarts/lib/echarts&#39;;\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"tree-shaking-api\">tree-shaking API</h5>\n<p>In 5.0.1, we introduced the new <a href=\"tutorial.html#Use%20ECharts%20with%20bundler%20and%20NPM\" target=\"_blank\">tree-shaking API</a></p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-js\">import * as echarts from &#39;echarts/core&#39;;\nimport { BarChart } from &#39;echarts/charts&#39;;\nimport { GridComponent } from &#39;echarts/components&#39;;\n// Note that the Canvas renderer is no longer included by default and needs to be imported explictly, or import the SVGRenderer if you need to use the SVG rendering mode\nimport { CanvasRenderer } from &#39;echarts/renderers&#39;;\n\necharts.use([BarChart, GridComponent, CanvasRenderer]);\n</code></pre>\n<p>To make it easier for you to know which modules you need to import based on your option, our new example page adds a new feature to generate the three-shakable code, you can check the <code class=\"codespan\">Full Code</code> tab on the example page to see the modules you need to introduce and the related code.</p>\n<p>In most cases, we recommend using the new tree-shaking interface whenever possible, as it maximizes the power of the packaging tool tree-shaking and effectively resolves namespace conflicts and prevents the exposure of internal structures. If you are still using the CommonJS method of writing modules, the previous approach is still supported:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-js\">const echarts = require(&#39;echarts/lib/echarts&#39;);\nrequire(&#39;echarts/lib/chart/bar&#39;);\nrequire(&#39;echarts/lib/component/grid&#39;);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Second, because our source code has been rewritten using TypeScript, <code class=\"codespan\">v5</code> will no longer support importing files from <code class=\"codespan\">echarts/src</code>.

The requirements includes: &quot;what does the data like&quot;, &quot;what the diagram we need&quot;, &quot;what components we need&quot;, &quot;what the user interactions we need&quot;, etc. In short, <code class=\"codespan\">option</code> defines: <code class=\"codespan\">data</code>, <code class=\"codespan\">visual mapping</code>, <code class=\"codespan\">interaction</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-js\">// Create an echarts instance.\nvar dom = document.getElementById(&#39;dom-id&#39;);\nvar chart = echarts.init(dom);\n\n// Use option to describe `data`, `visual mapping`, `interaction`, ...\n// `option` is a big JavaScript object.\nvar option = {\n    // Each property represents a kind of components.\n    legend: {...},\n    grid: {...},\n    tooltip: {...},\n    toolbox: {...},\n    dataZoom: {...},\n    visualMap: {...},\n    // If there are more than one components in one kind, we use an array.\n    // For example, there are three x axes here.\n    xAxis: [\n        // Each item represents an instance of component.\n        // `type` is used to indicate the sub-type of the component.\n        {type: &#39;category&#39;, ...},\n        {type: &#39;category&#39;, ...},\n        {type: &#39;value&#39;, ...}\n    ],\n    yAxis: [{...}, {...}],\n    // There are multiple series, using an array.\n    series: [\n        // `type` is also used to indicate the sub-type\n        // (i.e., diagram type) of each series.\n        {type: &#39;line&#39;, data: [[&#39;AA&#39;, 332], [&#39;CC&#39;, 124], [&#39;FF&#39;, 412], ... ]},\n        {type: &#39;line&#39;, data: [2231, 1234, 552, ... ]},\n        {type: &#39;line&#39;, data: [[4, 51], [8, 12], ... ]}\n    }]\n};\n\n// Call `setOption` and input the `option`. And then the\n// echarts instance processes data and renders charts.\nchart.setOption(option);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Data is put in <a href=\"option.html#series.data\" target=\"_blank\">series.data</a> in the above example. And we give another example showing another way, where each series retrieves data from <a href=\"option.html#dataset\" target=\"_blank\">dataset</a>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-js\">var option = {\n    dataset: {\n        source: [\n            [121, &#39;XX&#39;, 442, 43.11],\n            [663, &#39;ZZ&#39;, 311, 91.14],\n            [913, &#39;ZZ&#39;, 312, 92.12],\n            ...\n        ]\n    },\n    xAxis: {},\n    yAxis: {},\n    series: [\n        // Each series retrieves data from `dataset`.

This approach is like the absolute positioning in CSS. The absolute positioning is based on the container DOM element of the echarts.</p>\n<p>The value of each attribute can be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Absolute value (like <code class=\"codespan\">bottom: 54</code>, means: the distance from the boundary of the echarts container to bottom boundary of the component is <code class=\"codespan\">54</code> pixel).</li>\n<li>Or the percentage based on the width/height of the echarts container (like <code class=\"codespan\">right: &#39;20%&#39;</code>, means: the distance from the boundary of the echarts container to the right boundary of this component is <code class=\"codespan\">20%</code> of the width of the echarts container).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Check the example below, where the <a href=\"option.html#grid\" target=\"_blank\">grid</a> component (that is the baseboard of a Cartesian coordinate system) are configured with <code class=\"codespan\">left</code>、<code class=\"codespan\">right</code>、<code class=\"codespan\">height</code>、<code class=\"codespan\">bottom</code>.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img width=\"800\" height=\"auto\" src=\"documents/asset/img/basic-concepts-overview/locate.jpg\"></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Note that <code class=\"codespan\">left</code> <code class=\"codespan\">right</code> <code class=\"codespan\">width</code> are one group of attributes for horizontal layout, while <code class=\"codespan\">top</code> <code class=\"codespan\">bottom</code> <code class=\"codespan\">height</code> are another group of attributes for vertical layout. The two groups have nothing to do with each other. In each group, it is enough to set only one or at most two attributes. For example, when <code class=\"codespan\">left</code> and <code class=\"codespan\">right</code> have been specified, <code class=\"codespan\">width</code> can be automatically calculated by them.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>[Center-radius positioning]</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>A few circular components or series need to be positioned by &quot;center&quot; and &quot;radius&quot;. For example, <a href=\"option.html#series-pie\" target=\"_blank\">pie</a> (pie chart)、<a href=\"option.html#series-sunburst\" target=\"_blank\">sunburst</a> (sunburst chart)、<a href=\"option.html#polar\" target=\"_blank\">polar</a> (polar coordinate system).</p>\n<p>As the name implies, it position the component according to <a href=\"option.html#series-pie.center\" target=\"_blank\">center</a> and <a href=\"option.html#series-pie.radius\" target=\"_blank\">radius</a>.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>[Other positioning]</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>A few other components may has their own specific positioning approach. Check their docs before using them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"coordinate-system\">Coordinate system</h2>\n<p>Many series, like <a href=\"option.html#series-line\" target=\"_blank\">line</a>, <a href=\"option.html#series-bar\" target=\"_blank\">bar</a>, <a href=\"option.html#series-scatter\" target=\"_blank\">scatter</a>, <a href=\"option.html#series-heatmap\" target=\"_blank\">heatmap</a>, etc., need to work on a coordinate system. Coordinate system is used to layout each graphic elements and display some ticks and labels. For example, echarts at least provides these coordinate systems: <a href=\"option.html#grid\" target=\"_blank\">Cartesian coordinate system</a>, <a href=\"option.html#polar\" target=\"_blank\">polar coordinate system</a>, <a href=\"option.html#geo\" target=\"_blank\">GEO coordinate system</a>, <a href=\"option.html#singleAxis\" target=\"_blank\">single axis coordinate system</a>, <a href=\"option.html#calendar\" target=\"_blank\">calendar coordinate system</a>, etc. Some other series like <a href=\"option.html#series-pie\" target=\"_blank\">pie</a>, <a href=\"option.html#series-tree\" target=\"_blank\">tree</a>, work independently without any coordinate systems. And still some other series like <a href=\"option.html#series-graph\" target=\"_blank\">graph</a> are available either independently or on some coordinate system, depending on user settings.</p>\n<p>A coordinate system may consist of several components. For example, Cartesian coordinate system consists of <a href=\"option.html#xAxis\" target=\"_blank\">xAxis</a>, <a href=\"option.html#yAxis\" target=\"_blank\">yAxis</a> and <a href=\"option.html#grid\" target=\"_blank\">grid</a> (the baseboard). <a href=\"option.html#xAxis\" target=\"_blank\">xAxis</a> and <a href=\"option.html#yAxis\" target=\"_blank\">yAxis</a> are referenced and assembled by <code class=\"codespan\">grid</code> and work together cooperatively.</p>\n<p>The following example demonstrates the most simple way to use a Cartesian coordinate system, where only <a href=\"option.html#xAxis\" target=\"_blank\">xAxis</a>, <a href=\"option.html#yAxis\" target=\"_blank\">yAxis</a> and a <a href=\"option.html#series-scatter\" target=\"_blank\">scatter series</a> are declared, and <code class=\"codespan\">echarts</code> create and a <code class=\"codespan\">grid</code> implicitly to link them.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img width=\"450\" height=\"auto\" src=\"documents/asset/img/basic-concepts-overview/coord-sys-0.jpg\"></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>And the following example demonstrates a more complicated case, where two <a href=\"option.html#yAxis\" target=\"_blank\">yAxis</a> share one <a href=\"option.html#xAxis\" target=\"_blank\">xAxis</a>. And the two <code class=\"codespan\">series</code> are also share the <a href=\"option.html#xAxis\" target=\"_blank\">xAxis</a>, but use different <a href=\"option.html#yAxis\" target=\"_blank\">yAxis</a> respectively. The property <a href=\"option.html#series-line.yAxisIndex\" target=\"_blank\">yAxisIndex</a> is used to specify which <a href=\"option.html#yAxis\" target=\"_blank\">yAxis</a> is used.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img width=\"600\" height=\"auto\" src=\"documents/asset/img/basic-concepts-overview/coord-sys-1.jpg\"></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The following echarts instance contain more than one <a href=\"option.html#grid\" target=\"_blank\">grid</a>. Each <a href=\"option.html#grid\" target=\"_blank\">grid</a> has its own <a href=\"option.html#xAxis\" target=\"_blank\">xAxis</a> and <a href=\"option.html#yAxis\" target=\"_blank\">yAxis</a>. The properties <a href=\"option.html#series-line.xAxisIndex\" target=\"_blank\">xAxisIndex</a>, <a href=\"option.html#series-line.yAxisIndex\" target=\"_blank\">yAxisIndex</a> and <a href=\"option.html#yAxis.gridIndex\" target=\"_blank\">gridIndex</a> are used to specify the reference relationships.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><img width=\"600\" height=\"auto\" src=\"documents/asset/img/basic-concepts-overview/coord-sys-2.jpg\"></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Moreover, a type of series is usually available on various coordinate systems. For example, a <a href=\"option.html#series-scatter\" target=\"_blank\">scatter series</a> can work on <a href=\"option.html#grid\" target=\"_blank\">Cartesian coordinate system</a>, <a href=\"option.html#polar\" target=\"_blank\">polar coordinate system</a>, <a href=\"option.html#geo\" target=\"_blank\">GEO coordinate system</a> or other coordinate systems. Similarly, a coordinate system can serve different type of series. As the examples shown above, a <a href=\"option.html#grid\" target=\"_blank\">Cartesian coordinate system</a> serves several <a href=\"option.html#series-line\" target=\"_blank\">line series</a> and <a href=\"option.html#series-bar\" target=\"_blank\">bar series</a>.</p>\n"},"Customized Chart Styles":{"type":["*"],"description":"<p>Apache ECharts<sup>TM</sup> provides a rich amount of configurable items, which can be set in global, series, and data three different levels.

The options in <a href=\"option.html#series-scatter.emphasis\" target=\"_blank\">emphasis</a> is the same as the ones for normal state, for example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-js\">option = {\n    series: {\n        type: &#39;scatter&#39;,\n\n        // Styles for normal state.\n        itemStyle: {\n            // Color of the point.\n            color: &#39;red&#39;\n        },\n        label: {\n            show: true,\n            // Text of labels.\n            formatter: &#39;This is a normal label.&#39;\n        },\n\n        // Styles for emphasis state.\n        emphasis: {\n            itemStyle: {\n                // Color in emphasis state.\n                color: &#39;blue&#39;\n            },\n            label: {\n                show: true,\n                // Text in emphasis.\n                formatter: &#39;This is a emphasis label.&#39;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice: Before ECharts4, the emphasis style should be written like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-js\">option = {\n    series: {\n        type: &#39;scatter&#39;,\n\n        itemStyle: {\n            // Styles for normal state.\n            normal: {\n                color: &#39;red&#39;\n            },\n            // Styles for emphasis state.\n            emphasis: {\n                color: &#39;blue&#39;\n            }\n        },\n\n        label: {\n            // Styles for normal state.\n            normal: {\n                show: true,\n                formatter: &#39;This is a normal label.&#39;\n            },\n            // Styles for emphasis state.\n            emphasis: {\n                show: true,\n                formatter: &#39;This is a emphasis label.&#39;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The option format is still <strong>compatible</strong>, but not recommended. In fact, in most cases, users only set normal style, and use the default emphasis style. So since ECharts4, we support to write style without the &quot;normal&quot; term, which makes the option more simple and neat.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<hr>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Visual encoding (visualMap component)</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"option.html#visualMap\" target=\"_blank\">visualMap component</a> supports config the rule that mapping value to visual channel (color, size, ...).

In the examples above, we use 2d-array to carry the 2d-table. When we set <code class=\"codespan\">seriesLayoutBy</code> as <code class=\"codespan\">&#39;column&#39;</code>, namely, mapping columns to series, each column is called a dimension, and each row is a data item. When we set <code class=\"codespan\">seriesLayoutBy</code> as <code class=\"codespan\">&#39;row&#39;</code>, namely, mapping rows to series, each row is called a dimension, and each column is a data item.</p>\n<p>Dimension can have its name to displayed on charts. Dimension name can be defined on the first row/column. Take the code above as an example, <code class=\"codespan\">&#39;score&#39;</code>、<code class=\"codespan\">&#39;amount&#39;</code>、<code class=\"codespan\">&#39;product&#39;</code> are dimension names, and data start from the second row. By default ECharts auto detect whether the first row/column of <code class=\"codespan\">dataset.source</code> is dimension name or data. Use can also set <code class=\"codespan\">dataset.sourceHeader</code> as <code class=\"codespan\">true</code> to mandatorily specify the first row/column is dimension name, or set as <code class=\"codespan\">false</code> to indicate the data start from the first row/column.</p>\n<p>The definitions of the dimensions can also be provided separately in <code class=\"codespan\">dataset.dimensions</code> or <code class=\"codespan\">series.dimensions</code>, where not only dimension name, but also dimension type can be specified:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-js\">var option1 = {\n    dataset: {\n        dimensions: [\n            // Each item can be object or string.\n            {name: &#39;score&#39;},\n            // A string indicates the dimension name.\n            &#39;amount&#39;,\n            // Dimension type can be specified.\n            {name: &#39;product&#39;, type: &#39;ordinal&#39;}\n        ],\n        source: [...]\n    },\n    ...\n};\n\nvar option2 = {\n    dataset: {\n        source: [...]\n    },\n    series: {\n        type: &#39;line&#39;,\n        // Dimensions declared in series will be adapted with higher priority.\n        dimensions: [\n            null, // Set as null means we dont want to set dimension name.\n            &#39;amount&#39;,\n            {name: &#39;product&#39;, type: &#39;ordinal&#39;}\n        ]\n    },\n    ...\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Generally, we do not need to set dimensions types, because it can be auto detected based on data by ECharts. But in some cases, for example, the data is empty, the detection might not be accurate, where dimension type can be set manually.</p>\n<p>The optional values of dimension types can be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"codespan\">&#39;number&#39;</code>: Normal data, default value.</li>\n<li><code class=\"codespan\">&#39;ordinal&#39;</code>: Represents string data like category data or text data. ECharts will auto detect them by default. They can be set manually if the detection fail.</li>\n<li><code class=\"codespan\">&#39;time&#39;</code>: Represents time data, where it is supported that parse time string to timestamp.

But sometimes when container is of extreme size, this method cannot avoid component overlapping automatically, especially on small screens on mobile-end.</p>\n<p>Besides, sometimes one chart may need to be displayed on both PC and mobile-end, which involves the ability of ECharts inner components to be responsive with different container sizes.</p>\n<p>To solve this problem, ECharts improved component location algorithm, and implemented responsive ability similar to <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/\" target=\"_blank\">CSS Media Query</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"location-and-layout-of-echarts-components\">Location and layout of ECharts components</h2>\n<p>Most <em>component</em> and <em>series</em> follow two locating methods:</p>\n<p><br>\n<strong>left/right/top/bottom/width/height locating method:</strong></p>\n<p>Each of those six parameters can be <em>absolute value</em> or <em>percentage</em> or <em>location description</em>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Absolute value</p>\n<p>  in browser pixels (px); in form of <code class=\"codespan\">number</code> (no unit); e.g.: <code class=\"codespan\">{left: 23, height: 400}</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Percentage</p>\n<p>  to the width and height of DOM container; in form of <code class=\"codespan\">string</code>; e.g.: <code class=\"codespan\">{right: &#39;30%&#39;, bottom: &#39;40%&#39;}</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Location Description</p>\n<ul>\n<li>can be set to <code class=\"codespan\">left: &#39;center&#39;</code>, for horizontally centering.</li>\n<li>can be set to <code class=\"codespan\">top: &#39;middle&#39;</code>, for vertically centering.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The concept of these six parameters is similar to that in CSS:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>left: distance to left border of DOM container.</li>\n<li>right: distance to right border of DOM container.</li>\n<li>top: distance to top border of DOM container.</li>\n<li>bottom: distance to bottom border of DOM container.</li>\n<li>width: width.</li>\n<li>height: height.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Two out of the three horizontal parameters, <code class=\"codespan\">left</code>, <code class=\"codespan\">right</code>, <code class=\"codespan\">width</code>, are enough to determine the component location. For example, <code class=\"codespan\">left</code> and <code class=\"codespan\">right</code>, or <code class=\"codespan\">right</code> and <code class=\"codespan\">width</code> can both determine component location and size.\nThe same goes for vertical paramters <code class=\"codespan\">top</code>, <code class=\"codespan\">bottom</code> and <code class=\"codespan\">height</code>.</p>\n<p><br>\n<strong>Locating method of <code class=\"codespan\">center</code> / <code class=\"codespan\">radius</code>: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><code class=\"codespan\">center</code></p>\n<p>  an array in form of <code class=\"codespan\">[x, y]</code>, in which <code class=\"codespan\">x</code> and <code class=\"codespan\">y</code> can either be <em>absolute value</em> or <em>percentage</em>, as described above.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><code class=\"codespan\">radius</code></p>\n<p>  an array in form of <code class=\"codespan\">[innerRadius, outerRadius]</code>, in which <code class=\"codespan\">innerRadius</code> and <code class=\"codespan\">outerRadius</code> can either be <em>absolute value</em> or <em>percentage</em>, as described above.</p>\n<p>  Percentage location turns out to be very useful for responsive positioning.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br>\n<strong>Horizontal and vertical</strong></p>\n<p>Most of ECharts&#39;s long and narrow components (such as <code class=\"codespan\">legend</code>,<code class=\"codespan\">visualMap</code>,<code class=\"codespan\">dataZoom</code>,<code class=\"codespan\">timeline</code> and so on), provide option to set them to be horizontal or vertical. For example, long and narrow screen of mobile-end, vertical layout may be a more suitable choice, while horizontal may more suit for PC&#39;s wide screen.</p>\n<p>Setting of horizontal or vertical layout is usually with component or series&#39;s <code class=\"codespan\">orient</code> or <code class=\"codespan\">layout</code> option, which can be set to <code class=\"codespan\">&#39;horizontal&#39;</code> or <code class=\"codespan\">&#39;vertical&#39;</code>.</p>\n<p><br>\n<strong>Compatibility with ECharts2: </strong></p>\n<p>Naming of <code class=\"codespan\">x/x2/y/y2</code> in ECharts2 is still compatible, as well as the newly added <code class=\"codespan\">left/right/top/bottom</code>.

But they have one common feature, that they are a collection of <code class=\"codespan\">dataItem</code>s. Every data item contains data value, and other information if needed. Every data value can be a single value (one dimension) or an array (multiple dimensions).</p>\n<p>For example, <a href=\"option.html#series.data\" target=\"_blank\">series.data</a> is the most common form, which is a <code class=\"codespan\">list</code>, a common array:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-javascript\">series: {\n    data: [\n        {       // every item here is a dataItem\n            value: 2323, // this is data value\n            itemStyle: {...}\n        },\n        1212,   // it can also be a value of dataItem, which is a more common case\n        2323,   // every data value here is one dimension\n        4343,\n        3434\n    ]\n}\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-javascript\">series: {\n    data: [\n        {                        // every item here is a dataItem\n            value: [3434, 129,  &#39;San Marino&#39;], // this is data value\n            itemStyle: {...}\n        },\n        [1212, 5454, &#39;Vatican&#39;],   // it can also be a value of dataItem, which is a more common case\n        [2323, 3223, &#39;Nauru&#39;],     // every data value here is three dimension\n        [4343, 23,   &#39;Tuvalu&#39;]    // If is scatter chart, usually map the first dimension to x axis,\n                                 // the second dimension to y axis,\n                                 // and the third dimension to symbolSize\n    ]\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Usually the first one or two dimensions are used for mapping.

In the scope of Apache ECharts<sup>TM</sup>, they are usually alternative, without critical differences. But in some environment and scenarios, they show notable differences in performance or functionality.</p>\n<p>ECharts has been using Canvas as its renderer (use VML for IE8-) from the beginning. As of <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/echarts/releases\" target=\"_blank\">ECharts v3.8</a> we provide an SVG renderer (beta version) as another option. Either of them can be used by specifing parameter <a href=\"api.html#echarts.init\" target=\"_blank\">renderer</a> as <code class=\"codespan\">&#39;canvas&#39;</code> or <code class=\"codespan\">&#39;svg&#39;</code> when initailizing a chart instance.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Both SVG and Canvas, which are very different rendering implementations, are supported in ECharts by leveraging the Canvas and SVG renderers offered by the <a href=\"https://github.com/ecomfe/zrender\" target=\"_blank\">zrender</a> library.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-make-a-choice-\">How to make a choice?</h2>\n<p>Generally speaking, Canvas is suitable for cases where there is a large amount of graphical elements (usually due to a large amount of data points), like heatmap and lines or scatter plot with large data in geo or parallel coordinates. In addition, it supports some <a href=\"https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/editor.html?c=lines-bmap-effect\" target=\"_blank\">special visual effect</a> not supported by SVG. However, in some other scenarios SVG has some critical advantages: it consumes less memory than Canvas (especially in mobile devices), and gives better performance in rendering. Moreover, it never blurs when zooming the viewport of the browser whereas Canvas may blur.</p>\n<p>How to make a choice? These factors, hardware and software environment, data amount and functional requirements, should be considered.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When not constrained by hardware/software, and the data amount is not large, both should provide equally satisfactory results.</li>\n<li>When encountering performance issues, we can attempt to get better result by choose appropriate renderer.<ul>\n<li>If lots of ECharts instances have to be created, and it causes the browser crash (probably caused by that the large memory consumption) we can try the SVG renderer. Or, generally, when running on some old Android devices, or if we are using some kind of charts like <a href=\"https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-liquidfill/example/\" target=\"_blank\">liquidfill</a>, the SVG renderer probably gives a better performance.</li>\n<li>If visualizing a large amount of data, or complicated human interactions with data is required, the Canvas renderer works better currently.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Therefore <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/new\" target=\"_blank\">feedback</a> of experiences and usage scenarios are strongly welcomed, which will help improve the these renderers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-use-specify-a-renderer-\">How to use specify a renderer?</h2>\n<p>ECharts uses Canvas by default.

Apache ECharts<sup>TM</sup> 4 complies with this specification by supporting the automatic generation of intelligent descriptions based on chart configuration items, allowing blind people to understand the chart content with the help of a reading device, making the chart accessible to a wider audience.</p>\n<p>By default, ARIA is disabled. To enable it, you should set <a href=\"#aria.enabled\">aria.enabled</a> to be <code class=\"codespan\">true</code>. After enabling, it will generate descriptions based on charts, series, data, and so on. Users may change the generated description.</p>\n<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>\n<p>For config:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-js\">option = {\n    aria: {\n        show: true\n    },\n    title: {\n        text: &#39;Source of user access to a site&#39;,\n        x: &#39;center&#39;\n    },\n    series: [\n        {\n             Name: &#39;access source&#39;,\n            type: &#39;pie&#39;,\n            data: [\n                { value: 335, name: &#39;direct access&#39; },\n                { value: 310, name: &#39;mail marketing&#39; },\n                { value: 234, name: &#39;union ad&#39; },\n                { value: 135, name: &#39;video ad&#39; },\n                { value: 1548, name: &#39;search engine&#39; }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n};\n</code></pre>\n<iframe data-src=\"https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/view.html?c=doc-example/aria-pie&edit=1&reset=1\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" ></iframe>\n\n\n<p>There should be an <code class=\"codespan\">aria-label</code> attribute on the chart DOM, which can help the disabled understand the content of charts with the help of certain devices. The value of the label is:</p>\n<pre><code>This is a chart of &quot;Source of user access to a site.&quot; The chart type is a pie chart that indicates the source of the visit. The data is - direct access data is 335, mail marketing data is 310, union ad data is 234, video ad data is 135, search engine data is 1548.\n</code></pre><p>The default language is in defined by the language package (Chinese by default), but you can configure it with templates.</p>\n<p>In addition, Apache ECharts 5 now supports applique textures as a secondary expression of color to further differentiate data. If <code class=\"codespan\">aria.enabled</code> is set to <code class=\"codespan\">true</code>, <code class=\"codespan\">aria.decal.show</code> is set to <code class=\"codespan\">true</code> to adopt the default applique style.</p>\n<iframe data-src=\"https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/view.html?c=doc-example/aria-decal-simple&edit=1&reset=1\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" ></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, let&#39;s describe more specifically how these two accessible designs can be configured.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chart-labels\">Chart Labels</h2>\n<h3 id=\"apply-overall-modification-description\">Apply Overall Modification Description</h3>\n<p>For some charts, the default generated descriptions of the data points are not sufficient to represent the overall information. For example, in the scatter plot below, the default description can include the coordinates of the data points, but knowing the coordinates of hundreds or thousands of points does not help us to effectively understand the information presented in the chart.</p>\n<p><img width=\"600\" height=\"auto\" src=\"documents/asset/img/aria-example.png\"></p>\n<p>At this point, the user can specify the overall description of the chart via the <a href=\"option.html#aria.label.description\" target=\"_blank\">aria.label.description</a> configuration item.</p>\n<h3 id=\"customizing-the-template-description\">Customizing the Template Description</h3>\n<p>In addition to modifying descriptions holistically, we also provide templates for generating descriptions that can be easily modified at a fine-grained level.</p>\n<p>The basic flow for generating descriptions is that if <a href=\"option.html#aria.label.show\" target=\"_blank\">aria.label.description</a> is set to <code class=\"codespan\">true</code>, then the accessibility description is generated, otherwise it is not. If <a href=\"option.html#aria.label.description\" target=\"_blank\">aria.label.description</a> is defined, it is used as the full description of the chart, otherwise the description is generated according to the template stitching. We provide a default algorithm for generating descriptions, and only if the generated descriptions are not quite right, we need to modify these templates, or even override them completely with <code class=\"codespan\">aria.description</code>.</p>\n<p>When using the template, whether <a href=\"#title.text\">title.text</a> is used along with <a href=\"option.html#aria.label.general.withTitle\" target=\"_blank\">aria.label.general.withTitle</a> while <a href=\"option.html#aria.label.general.withoutTitle\" target=\"_blank\">aria.label.general.withoutTitle</a> is used if there is no title text. <code class=\"codespan\">aria.general.withTitle</code> supports a template <code class=\"codespan\">&#39;{title}&#39;</code>, which will be replaced with chart title. This means, if <code class=\"codespan\">aria.general.withTitle</code> is set to be <code class=\"codespan\">&#39;The chart title is {title}.&#39;</code> and the chart title is <code class=\"codespan\">Price Distribution</code>, it will be interpreted into <code class=\"codespan\">&#39;The chart title is Price Distribution.&#39;</code></p>\n<p>After generating the title, the description of the series (<a href=\"option.html#aria.label.series\" target=\"_blank\">aria.label.series</a>) and the description of the data for each series (<a href=\"option.html#aria.label.data\" target=\"_blank\">aria.label.data</a>) are generated in turn. The following is an example of a template. Likewise, each template may include template variables to replace actual values.</p>\n<h2 id=\"decal-pattern\">Decal Pattern</h2>\n<p>The way to use the default applique pattern was described above. If you need to customize the decal pattern, you can use <a href=\"option.html#aria.decal.decals\" target=\"_blank\">aria.decal.decals</a> to configure a flexible decal pattern.</p>\n<iframe data-src=\"https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/view.html?c=doc-example/aria-decal&edit=1&reset=1\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" ></iframe>\n\n\n<p>Please refer to <a href=\"option.html#aria\" target=\"_blank\">ARIA option</a> for more detail.</p>\n"}}}}
