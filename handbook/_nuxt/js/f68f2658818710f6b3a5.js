Compared with the normal line chart, the area chart has more intuitive visual effects. It is especially suitable for the scenario with a few series.\n\n```js live\noption = {\n  xAxis: {\n    data: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']\n  },\n  yAxis: {},\n  series: [\n    {\n      data: [10, 22, 28, 23, 19],\n      type: 'line',\n      areaStyle: {}\n    },\n    {\n      data: [25, 14, 23, 35, 10],\n      type: 'line',\n      areaStyle: {\n        color: '#ff0',\n        opacity: 0.5\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n};\n```\n\nIf you want to change the area style of the line chart, try to use [`areaStyle`](${optionPath}series-line.areaStyle). Set `'areaStyle'` to `{}` to use the default type: use the color of series to fill the area in translucent. If you want to change the style, try to override the configuration items in `'areaStyle'`. For example, the color of the second series was changed to yellow with 50% opacity.\n"}}]);
