Therefore, in Apache ECharts 5.4.0, we introduced the concept of \"intelligent pointer snapping\".\n\nSee [intelligent pointer snapping](${lang}/how-to/interaction/coarse-pointer) for details.\n\n## Using Pie charts in more coordinate systems\n\nA very powerful feature of Apache ECharts is the combination of various chart types, coordinate systems, and components. In this version, we have added the coordinate systems option for pie charts.\n\nThus, pie charts can appear in the Cartesian coordinate systems,\n\n![](images/5-4-0/pie-grid.png)\n\ncalendar coordinate systems,\n\n![](images/5-4-0/pie-calendar.png)\n\ngeographical coordinate systems,\n\n![](images/5-4-0/pie-geo.png)\n\nand even with the Baidu Map and Gaode Map extension.\n\n![](images/5-4-0/pie-bmap.png)\n\n![](images/5-4-0/pie-amap.png)\n\nThis greatly extends the flexibility of pie charts, allowing developers to create more combinations of chart effects using Apache ECharts.\n\n## Ukrainian Translation\n\nIn this release, we added the support of the Ukrainian language. **Now Apache ECharts supports 17 languages!**\n\n> If you need to use a language other than English or Chinese, you need to call `echarts.registerLocale` to initialize the chart before initializing it, and then pass `opts.locale` to modify the chart language during `init`.\n\n## Gauge Label Rotation\n\nIn this version, we support text rotation of the Gauge series.\n\n<md-example src=\"gauge-grade\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" />\n\n`axisLabel.rotate` can be set to `'tangential' | 'radial' | number`. If it is of type `number`, it indicates the rotation angle of the label from -90 degrees to 90 degrees, with positive values being counterclockwise. In addition to this, it can also be the strings `'radial'` for radial rotation and `'tangential'` for tangential rotation.\n\n## Full Changelog\n\nView the [Changelog](${mainSitePath}/changelog.html#v5-4-0)\n"}}]);
